# Utilities

This repo is a compendium of utilities developed in Python to avoid using websites for similar tasks.

To use the functions in this repo, create a conda environment with the following commands:

```
conda 
conda activate utilities
```

After you have created and activated the conda environment. You can call the desired function with the following command:

```
python -c "import myscript; myscript.myfunc(a, b)"
```

Where `myscript` is the Python file that you want to run, `myfunc` is the function inside the script, and `a` and `b` are the parameters to pass to the function.
